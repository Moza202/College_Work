# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — College Coursework

Welcome to my **Data Structures** portfolio!  
This repository aims to **implement, explain, and explore** fundamental computer science concepts using **C++**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of linear and non-linear data structures built from scratch.

## 📘 About

This repository is designed for revision and understanding core concepts. It includes:

- **Implementation from Scratch**: Understanding the internal logic of Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees.
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world usage examples (e.g., Expression balancing, Number conversion).
- **Complexity Analysis**: A study guide covering Big-O notation for sorting algorithms.
- **Study Resources**: A dedicated cheat sheet for STL containers and mathematical utilities.
